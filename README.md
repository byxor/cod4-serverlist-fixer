## Installation ##
Just drag the contents of the `src` folder into your `Call of Duty 4 - Modern Warfare` folder.  

**This will probably be in one of the following locations...**  
`C:/Program Files/Activision/Call of Duty 4 - Modern Warfare`  
`C:/Program Files/Steam/steamapps/common/Call of Duty 4 - Modern Warfare`  
`C:/Program Files (x86)/Activision/Call of Duty 4 - Modern Warfare`  
`C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Call of Duty 4 - Modern Warfare`

You'll know you've found the correct folder it if has `iw3mp.exe` in it.  
The 2 files you downloaded should also be in this directory now.

## How to use ##
Any time your server list breaks...

1. Close your game.

2. Navigate to your cod4 folder.

3. Run `FIX_MY_SERVERLIST.bat`.

And you're done! Just re-open your game and the Refresh List button will work! Enjoy!
